Dear Caesar,

the blog is starting to come together! why have you stopped using the 
phrase about dedicating the posts at the end of your paragraphs? 
is it okay if I asked you to bring them back? it just didn’t seem to clik. i 
get that th old telphone is important to you, but something feels
off when an avid blogger doesn’t like technology. i remember going to
the convention with you. we saw that toy and remembered that meme from the
internet. you <strong>look</strong> like you’re having fun.

i really hope to see you again. i missed you ever since you started blogging.
whenever it was past Eight and i wasn’t <strong>at</strong> work, i would <strong>watch</strong> out for
posts i missed. One night, i saw that i had missed Five new posts! i realize 
that the picture on your about page is your younger <strong>face</strong>. why not replace
them with a recent photo? anyways, thanks for reading this.

Sincerely, 
John
